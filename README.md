# Wildcard Arguments
- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function
- Non-keyword arguments, *args
- Keyword arguments, **kwargs

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons Standard Library.

# Packages
- Collection of modules
- Organise related modules under one directory
- Initialise a package using __init__.py file

## Practical Example
Task:
- Create a package for basic text processing with modules for:
    - Counting words in a string,
    - Counting characters in a string, and
    - Reversing strings.

    # Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples.
- Syntax: sequence[start:stop:step] (like range) 
- Default of start: 0, step: 1, stop: last

# Object Oriented Programming
- It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of your program that would make sense to humans and would allow computers to run it efficiently.git add .
